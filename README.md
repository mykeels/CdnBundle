# CdnBundle
How do you bundle multiple remote and local JavaScript or CSS resources into a single file? CdnBundle is the one ring to bind them all!

ASP.NET doesn't let you do bundle remote resources because it's counter-intuitive. Is it? Google's Web Performance Tests show that the fewer script references you have, the better for your page. So how about having just one script and css reference, huh?
